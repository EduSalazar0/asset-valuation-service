# Asset Valuation Service

## Overview

The **Asset Valuation Service** is an asynchronous worker that plays a crucial role in the risk assessment pipeline. It consumes `asset.discovered` events from Kafka. For each discovered asset, this service applies the quantitative valuation methodology defined in the project's core documentation.

Specifically, it calculates scores for **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** and then aggregates them into a final **Quantitative Asset Score (SCA)**. This score represents the asset's importance and value to the organization.

After calculating the value, the service updates the asset's record in the database and publishes an `asset.valuated` event to Kafka, passing the baton to the next stage of the pipeline (Vulnerability Scanning).

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Messaging:** Apache Kafka
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Containerization:** Docker

## Core Logic: CIA/SCA Calculation

This service automates the "Cuestionario de Valoraci√≥n CIA" from the project methodology. Since direct user input is not available in an automated flow, the `CIACalculatorService` uses a **heuristic-based approach** to assign initial metric scores. For example, an asset with "api" in its name is given higher Confidentiality and Availability scores by default.

The final scores are calculated using the formulas:
- `Score_Dimension = (SUM(metric_scores) / num_metrics) * 10`
- `SCA = (SCA_C + SCA_I + SCA_D) / 3`

## Architecture

This service is a "headless" worker with no API. It adheres to **Clean Architecture**:

1.  **Domain:** Defines the `Asset` entity (including its value attributes) and the abstract repository interfaces.
2.  **Application:** Contains the `ValueAssetUseCase` and the core `CIACalculatorService`.
3.  **Infrastructure:** Provides concrete implementations for the PostgreSQL repository and Kafka producer.
4.  **Worker:** The main process that runs the Kafka consumer and orchestrates the use case execution.

## Getting Started

Follow the standard procedure: clone, create a virtual environment, install dependencies from `requirements.txt`, configure your `.env` file, and run `python main.py`.

## Disclaimer

This service is intended solely for educational and research purposes within authorized environments. It must **not** be used against systems, networks, or digital assets without explicit permission from their owners.

The valuation logic applied in this microservice is based on heuristic assumptions and simplified models; therefore, it should **not** be considered a substitute for a comprehensive risk assessment conducted by certified professionals.
